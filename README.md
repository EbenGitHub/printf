This is team project on creating our own printf function.
Done by ALX Software engineering students Abenezer Eshetie and Christina Solomon

This _printf fuction is created using variadic functions, structures, typedef, pointers and pointer functions, arrays ...
To use this _printf function, you need to pass string argument with in quotation and variable to the format specified in the string.
And the printf prints acconrdingly to the inputs and return number of characters passed through the first argument.

Example on how to use: _printf("This is my read me file");
This will print "This is my read me file" on the terminal
